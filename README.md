# Lokomu - Legacy Frontend

Not in development.

ðŸ’š The original name for the project was "del". It means "share" in Norwegian. Share your stuff and time with others. 

ðŸŽ“ This code was developed as part of a [Bachelor's project](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3078083) at NTNU Trondheim, Norway, for a B.Sc. in Computer Science Engineering.

ðŸš€ The frontend is currently being developed as a native mobile app using React Native.

## Project setup

To run the frontend node.js is required.

- Installation links
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install required dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

The frontend cannot run by itself and requires a backend service. The URL to this backend service needs to be provided in the environmental variables. This can be done in these steps

- Create a file with the name `.env` in the root folder
- If the backend service uses the default configuration insert this into the file
  ```
  VITE_BASEURL=http://localhost:3000/api/
  VITE_SUPPORTED_LOCALES=en,no
  VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
  VITE_FALLBACK_LOCALE=no
  ```

## Running the project

- To compile and run with hot-reloads for development

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- To compile and minify project for production
  ```
  npm run build
  ```

## Running tests

To run the tests run the command:

```
npm run test
```

This will run all the tests and provide a coverage report. Due to a bug with jest and vue there are tests and files missing in the coverage report. This is due to jest skipping files with `ES6` import.

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

This project was created by [Titas Virbickas](https://github.com/titusvi).

A heartfelt thank you to Zara Mudassar for her contributions to the development of the app during the bachelor thesis!
